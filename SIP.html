<h2>Description</h2>
<img src="UCG.jpg"width="430px"height="	230px"align="left">
<p>
       Because of the pandemic, the Badjao Community struggles <span>to place food on the table </span> due to their unstable source of income. Many of them in the community had to sell their businesses as well as their capitals.
	   Through this project, we aim to be able to find a solution to this problem. After further observation of their situation, we came up with an experiment where we find the best way to make food sources more accessible to those
	   in the community through the use of <span>UCG(Urban Container Gardening)</span>.  We've discovered that we are able to create a home-made compost using the leftover peelings of onions and garlic as they are high in nitrogen and potassium. Our project aims to figure out if the amount of 
        solution affect the growth of the plant.   Through this experiment, we are able to find a<span> stable source of food</span> for them as well as find a way for them to<span> spend less </span>on gardening materials and food supply.
</p>
 <h2> Why we must use compost?</h2>
<p>
     Compost is valuable as it’s a <span>natural fertilizer</span>. Food scraps and garden trash together account for more than 28 percent of the waste we discard,
	 which demonstrates the importance and advantages of composting. In addition, composting helps<span> reduce the waste</span> at landfills by "267 million tons of municipal waste" (Hu, n.d.). 
	 As composting is the most natural approach to dispose of natural waste, we/people should compost instead of tossing waste in waste bins.

<p>
 In my group, we will focus on the okra plant since it is<span> accessible to those in our community</span> and healthy for us. Some of the needed nutrients for okra 
 plants to grow and have a high harvest include nutrients like<span> nitrogen and potassium </span>. According to (Smith et al., 2022), “Once the plants are cut, gardeners 
 will want to fertilize with a fertilizer that has a 1:2 ratio of nitrogen to potassium, which will encourage<span> new growth and stimulate flower production</span>”. As stated by
 (Fertilizer 101: The Big 3 - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, 2016), “ Potassium helps<span> strengthen plants’</span> abilities to resist disease and plays an important role 
 in increasing crop yields and overall quality. Nitrogen is essential in the formation of protein, and protein makes up much of the tissues of most living things". 
 This shows how in order to give okra plants the strength, quality, and nutrients it needs, we must give them something that contains nitrogen
 and potassium which are both essential for plant growth and quality.

 <h2> Problem Statement and Hypothesis</h2>
 <h1> Problem Statement</h1>
 <p>Will the amount of solution(onion and garlic peelings solution) affect the height of the okra plant?</p>
 <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
 <p>   If we add 50 ml of the solution to setup A and 30 ml of the solution to setup B in 15-day intervals, then setup A will grow taller than setup B and the controlled set-up. </p>
