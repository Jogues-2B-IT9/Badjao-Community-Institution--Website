	  <h2> Pass It On Program (P.I.O)</h2>
	  <p>
	  Through this program, we hope to be able to share our knowledge with those who are unable to pursue their studies and essentially pass on the things we've learned to them.  By the end of the project, we hope to be
	  able to develop their knowledge and be able to enhance their reading and writing comprehension. We will be implementing all kinds of activities such as story-telling, letter writing, and many more so they'll be able to learn
	  in a fun and creative way .
	  </p>
	  <h2> Timeline</h2>
	  <p>
	       In the span of November to March, we hope to be able to do the following in order to have a successful project: <br>
	</p>
	  <h1> Pre-implementation</h1><br>
	  <p>
	  -  Before the implementation, we will  create a project proposal as well as practice our individual roles. We will also gather and prepare the needed materials for the project such as pre-loved and 
	  store-bought goods, power point presentations, scripts, prizes, and more. 
	  </p><br>
	  <h1> Implementation</h1><br>
	  <p>
	  -  During the implementation, we will be executing the activities we've planned such as storytelling, question and answer (with prizes), teaching sessions, and letter-writing.
	  </p>
	  <h1> Post-Implementation</h1><br>
	  <p>
	  - After the implementation, we will reflect on what we've done as well as share our thoughts and experiences during the pre-implementation and post-implementation. We will also reflect
	  on how we're able to improve the project and how we're able to find long-term solutions to our community's other challenges.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2> Budget Plan</h2>
	<p>
	As you can see here, because we will be<span> making use of pre-loved or reused items</span>, we don't need to spend too much on this project. Our <span>only expenses </span>would be the store-bought goods we plan to donate 
	 to them.
	</p>
	<h2>Relevance</h2>
	<p>
	This project is utterly important as it shows<span> relevance and the dire need </span>for the Badjao Community's education.  Due to their living conditions such as the lack of unstable income and education, they are unable to acquire jobs to provide for the
     needs of their children. Those who are able to continue their education are too embrassed to go due to their lack of reading and writing comprehension. Through this program, we are addressing the problems of this community. 
    We will be able to<span> enhance the minds of our generation</span> as well as give them the same opportunities that we were given.
