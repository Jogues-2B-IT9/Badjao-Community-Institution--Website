	  <h2> Community Background</h2>
	  <p>
	  <span> In the Badjao Community</span>, people rely on fishing as one of their main jobs. In the community, they are surrounded by water which makes it a blessing and a curse. Since they are closer to water, 
	  they can get food by fishing. They can also swim without proper gear which can help them fish well. However, since they are near water, they are as close to the risk of flooding, diseases, and drowning.
	  </p><br>
	  
	   <p>
	   The Badjao community faces poverty every day and due to their <span>unstable income</span>, they are unable to finish their education which affects finding work later on. Due to the pandemic, their members were 
	   forced to abandon their businesses in order to have food on their tables for their families as a result of the lockdown. The lack of gadgets and resources makes it difficult for kids to pursue their education.
	   tâ€™s even harder for them as they face<span>discrimination every day.</span>
	   </p><br>
	   
	   <p>
	   The Badjao community is located in Matina Aplaya, Isla Verde, Barangay 23-C and Bucana, Barangay 76-A, Davao City. To contact them, you can call either <span>Melody Adjiari or Lolita Adjiari</span>. 
	   The Badjao Community was established by the <span>BCPCH</span> (Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of the Cultural Heritage). As it imparts to us the virtues of love and
	   care for the community, BCPCH seeks to preserve this community. Taking into account that this culture views itself as a peaceful tribal tribe and is thought to be the most peaceful race on earth.
